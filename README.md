# QUESTudyante

a mobile-responsive web application that can be used in school but we also bring it home because every students begin learning at home. It serves as a platform for parents to help their children to maximize their full potential. Parents could subscribe and create accounts for their children. Parents could set series of activity to hone their passion and skills, and be productive for the day. It can be for academics, for their health, for chores, etc. In exchange, children will request something to have some fruit for their hardwork because we believe that achieving small goals can be fulfilling emotionally, physically, psychologically, etc. They will always feel that they accomplished something that is what are self-esteem needs. This application can better us.

## How to Install

1. Fork this repository. The fork button should be at the upper right of this page. Fork it to your personal GitHub profiles. By doing so, you'll have a copy of the application in your respective profiles. To check, your URL should be like this: `https://github.com/your_username/froyexpress`

2. After forking, clone it to your local machines. Forking gives you ownership to the copy of the project, thus you'll have automatic read and write (pull and push) privileges. No need to authenticate as long as you have configured your SSH keys.

3. After cloning, open a command line (terminal) and go to the boilerplate directory. Issue an `npm install` command. This will download module dependencies of the project. **Note that this requires a working internet connection**.

4. After installing all the dependencies, open the `.env.sample` file and copy the contents of it. Create a new `.env` file and paste everything in there. The sample file has comments in it for each field present.

5. Run the application using `node index.js` or `nodemon` if you have installed it (`npm install nodemon -g`).

Once all of those are satisfied, you should be able to see your list of users in the `/parents/login` route when you run the app.
